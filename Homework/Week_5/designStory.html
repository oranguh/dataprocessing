          <p>
            Pokemon vary greatly not only in appearance but also in stats.
            However, navigating through all of the strengths and weaknesses of
            these pokemon through the game or even a wiki can be tedious. I therefore
            thought it would be really handy to create a visualization where
            one can not only easily find relevant information about specific pokemon,
            but also between the myriad of pokemon out there.
          </br> </br>
            Because pokemon is about a game where stats matter, I decided to use
            the Annotated graph genre. However, the evolutions of pokemon would
            not have been justified with a graph, therefore the flowchart genre
            was applied to evolutions. This also reflects the datatype used
            in each figure. The graph uses numerical data, whereas the tree diagram
            uses categorical data
          </br> </br>
            Initially I wanted to display all 151 pokemon immediately onto the
            scatterplot so users could easily compare. However, due to server
            limitations the user has to manually ask for more pokemon. In hindsight
            I found this feature to be quite fun and inviting to use.
            As it mimics the Pokemon experience, you have to "catch"
            (or in this case query) pokemon. It was quite a fun project to work
            on and also quite fun to use! I would invite everyone to look around
            and try to find some interesting pokemon trivia.

          <h4 align = "center">Trivia facts I found exploring the visualization:</h4>
          <p>
            Did you know chansey has the highest hp in the whole game? (jigglypuff also has above average hp) pink=hp?
          </br>
            Did you know the self destruct pokemon electrode has a weight of 666?
          </br>
            Did you know that there are a lot of eevee evolutions? (8!!)
          </br>
            Did you know Dragonite has the highest total stats, with each stat being quite balanced?
          </br>
            Slowpoke is slow, with only 15 speed, but jugglypuff is not so far away with 20 speed
